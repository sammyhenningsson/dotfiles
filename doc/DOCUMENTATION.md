## API Documentation
Since API clients should basically only have to care about the payloads that are returned from the API, it makes sense to keep the API documentation in the serializer files. Each `attribute`, `link`, `curie` and `embed` should be preceeded with code comments that documents how client should interpret/use it. The comments should be in markdown format. This makes it possible to generate API documentation with `rake doc:generate`. This documentation can then be retrieved from a running server at `/doc/RESOURCE_NAME`, where `RESOURCE_NAME` is the name of the resource to fetch doc for, e.g `curl localhost:3000/doc/post`.
